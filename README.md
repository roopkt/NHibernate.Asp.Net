This is a sample project where I have added below things:
<ul>
<li>Simple NHiberanate uses.</li>
<li>Repository Pattern using NHibernate.</li>
<li>Test Project to test all samples</li>
<li>Using DI to inject Session object</li>

<h2>Notes on NHibernate</h2>
<ol>
<li>	Database has to be created manually.</li>
<li>	Fluent API can be written to do Mapping install (FluentNHibernate version="1.4.0.0" targetFramework="net35" )</li>
<li>	Tables can be generated by Code First & Fluent APIs. </li>
<li>	Each complex type must have its own Mapper for reusability or it can be merged in Entity Mapper</li>
<li>  Each Entity must have its own Mapper </li>
<li>	Each Entity must have one internal empty constructor only if it has any non-empty constructor.</li>
<li>	Each Persisted Property has to be marked as Virtual.</li>
<li>	Private setter on property will not work ( it has to be protected/public  internal set)</li>
<li>	Any setter method has to be marked as virtual.  </li>
